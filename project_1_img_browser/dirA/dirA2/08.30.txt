image:
A discrete 2D array
	width # of cols
	height # of rows
	Aspect ratio is width/height

Pixel coordinates may be represented using Vector notation
By convention, each vector is vertically oriented while its transpose is horizontally oriented

image storage into memory:
	colomu major order
	row major order

access image data
	Scanline: left to right
	raster scan order
	image accessed as 1D array of pixel, with indices in the range i =0,1...,n where n is width*height
	relationship between 1D and 2D arrays
		i = y * width + x
		x = i % width
		y = i / width

image types:
grayscale image
	number of bits used to store each gray level known as bit depth
		b bits imply 2^b gray level
		8 bits implt 256 gray level
		hexdecimal notation
RGB color image
	each pixel is a vector of 3 integers, reprensenting 3 color channels
	24 bits per pixel (bpp)
	pixel stored as (RGB & BGR)
	values of different colors stored as interleaved channels as B0G0R0B1G1R1.....BnGnRn
	other method for storage is planar layout with each color channel stored separately
		B0B1B2...G0G1G2...R1R2R..Rn

Alpha value or opacity
	00 indecates transparent while FF indicates opaque

Binary image
	each pixel is either black or white
	1 bpp, but displayed with 8 bpp
	useful for building masks to separate areas of image

Real-valued image, or floating point image
	32-bit floating point number; 64 bit double precision values, 16-bit half-precision values

Complex-valued images
	Output from computing the fourier transform of an image

Brightness if each pixel proportional to its value

Raw pixel as a height map or 3D surface plot
I(x,y) as the value of the function as position(x,y)
Grayscale image as a matrix of pixel value
color image as a matrix of 3-tuples
binary image as the set of pixel with value 1
